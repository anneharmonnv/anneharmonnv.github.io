<h1>Skills and Interests</h1>
<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
<p>
    Graphic design is kind of where I started, creatively. It was the calling card that lurred me into deeper waters. I've had fun playing with words, creating logos to represent myself, and using my skills in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create fun and interesting pieces. 
</p>

<h3>Marketing and Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Communications</li>
        <li>Social Media Analysis and Management</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Videography</h3>
<p>
    Everything from storyboarding, shooting, editing, sound design, and beyond. I've grown to love drafting and creating videos, and I think some of my best work has been in the video format.
</p> 
<h3>Storytelling</h3>
<p>
    I started my studies in Journalism becuase I love to tell stories. Specifically, other people's stories. I want to help other people find thier voice, and amplify them. Some of those ideas have changed through the years, but at the end of the day that is still the thing that keeps me going. No matter the medium, I like telling stories.
</p>
<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>
    This is a relativly new addition, but I am learning to code. I made this website from scratch and I'm very proud of it. Even if she is clunckier than a 2007 MySpace Account.
